## How to Use it

### 1. Fork or Clone this repository
> This is a public repository, so you can fork it to your own GitHub account.
> You can also clone it and create a private repository if you want to keep your data private.

The repository will contain the workflow that will be used to collect the data and generate the report.
The report will be generated in the README file and show you analytics of all the repositories you choose to analyze.

### 2. Add your GitHub Token in the repository secrets
The token is used to authenticate the GitHub API requests.
> You can create a new token by going to your GitHub account settings, then "Developer settings", then "Personal access tokens". Make sure to give it the `repo` scope.

- Go to your repository settings.
- Click on "Secrets and variables" in the left sidebar.
- Click on "Actions" under "Secrets and variables".
- Click on "New repository secret".
- Add a new secret with the name `GH_SECRET_TOKEN` and paste your GitHub token as the value.

### 3. Set up the configuration
You can configure the `theme` and `repositories` that you want to track by editing the `config.json` file. 
All themes are available in `themes.json` file, you can choose any of the themes listed there.

```json
{
  "script_to_run": "src/main.py",
  "data_dir": "./data",
  "images_dir": "./images",
  "theme": "chartreuse-dark",     # Add your favorite theme here
  "owner": "mriusero",            # Set up your GitHub username here
  "repositories": [
  "GitHub-Traffic-Insights"                 # List the repositories you want to track here
  ]
}
```

### 4. Configure the workflow (optional)
The workflow is set to run once a day.
